A description of the fields:
    worker_id_anon: anonymized worker ID;
    ref_id: reference ID;
    ref_len: reference length {5, 10, 20, 40};
    sys_id: ParaBank system(s) that produce(s) the paraphrase, except for
    system 35, which is ParaNMT, and system 0, which copies the reference;
    candidate: paraphrastic candidate produced by the ParaBank system(s);
    NLL: negative log likelihood produced of the candidate by the NMT model;
    human_score: human judgment score, ranging from 0 to 100;
    gm: grammaticality/fluency judged by annotators (0 - nonsensical, 1 -
    meaningful but ungrammatical, 2 - meaningful and grammatical).
